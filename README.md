# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

for this project i used W3schools.com as main source 
first i looked up accessibility what it is and why it is important, and as a future web developer why i need to know and be aware of it.

- accessibility is an important tool to be aware of and become comfortable using it 
- i decided to build this project so it can allow people with disabilities to access information like anyone else
- my project added details about the pictures on the web for with disabilities or someone with slow internet and if for any reason the image wont load then they will get a detailed description.
- in this assignment i learn a little bit more about attributes and about accessibility what it is and why it is important
